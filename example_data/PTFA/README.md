# Example data for a person with transfemoral amputation
This folder contains an example dataset gathered from a sprinting of a person with transfemoral amputation to test the code with.
Please follow the descriptions given in Di Marco, et al. (submitted 2025) and relevant Supplementary Materials to rebuilt the same PTFA.configuration XML file already given in this folder, which has to be used to process the PTFA_STATIC.c3d file together with the PTFA_WAND_<label>.c3d files and to process the dynamic PTFA_SPRINTING.c3d file.
